Work in progress on a witness configuration network.  So far joint work between
sigsum / trust fabric / transparency-dev / filippo.

See design proposal:

* ./docs/proposal.md

---Prototype site

See ./site/README for instructions how to render the site locally.  This is
basically an attempt to flesh out the above proposal for the target audience:
operators of logs and witnesses.

---Warning

This work will likely be moved and continued somewhere else.
