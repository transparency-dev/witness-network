From nisse and elias:

- Table vs list, is the distinguish really needed/helpful?  And if the
  distinguish is machine readable vs not, other more clear terminology?
- Want a "Security considerations" section on the deployed site.
  - Motivate better why it's important to just discover new logs in the list,
	i.e., it is not a good idea if removed in list = also removed in config
  - The maintainers are kind of a CA (origin -> key)
  - Something about origin line "verify" by maintainers / what review they do
    when operators ask to become participants
  - Something about maintainers not removing from log list?
  - Something about how the maintainers here are not the root of trust of
    trust policies, that's something log ecosystems set themselves.  And
	that trust in witness = has nothing to do with trust in maintainers.
- Is it in scope to have >1 vkey per origin line?
- nit: example log list and specification are inconsistent at the moment
- qpd: ok, works
- origin line: want it to be stated the operator should "own" the URL
- suggestion: clarify it's a public mailing list
- suggestion: log list name with <performance profile> = weird name if you
  haven't got any explanation about it.  Would be nice to explain it.
- Missing "test" things, e.g., test log list, test witnesses.
- Do we need somewhere to say "this is what's happening right now in the witness
  network"; "one witness had this particular issue..."?  Perhaps a timeline?
- Recommend trust policy - out of scope? Yes.
- If maintainers want to document decisions, enough to do that in git history;
  keep this simple so it doesn't become a headache to be a maintainer.
- Do all logs and witnesses need to participate? No.
- Overall: like the direction and the work done so far
