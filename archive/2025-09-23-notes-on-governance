Brief summary of our plan for governance:

  1. The individuals are the maintainers / stakeholders, not their
	 organizations.  But each individual can of course chose to list a
	 current affiliation, e.g., Google TrustFabric / Transparency.dev.
  2. A static witness network site is deployed on a domain that's not
	 tied to any of our organizations, and with a name that reflects
	 exactly what this is about (e.g., witness-network.org or similar).
  3. The maintainers need a working directory somewhere.  We're happy to
     have this publicly in the Transparency.Dev GitHub organization.
