# This is an experimental list where witnesses can discover logs.  The
# work-in-progress list format is described here:
#
#   https://github.com/transparency-dev/witness-network/blob/main/log-list-format.md
#
# Witnesses that discover logs from this list should be able to persist the
# states of 4,000 logs and support 10 add-checkpoint requests/s on average for
# all logs combined (e.g., 10x 1qps logs would make this list of logs "full").
