Demo site where the target audience is someone who knows what a transparency log
is, but who doesn't have all the details for witnessing cosigning or why they
probably want to participate in this witness configuration community.

Quickstart:

  apt install hugo
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  hugo serve

The site should appear on a localhost URL, see hugo output.
